Image Recognition Very Deep Convolutional Networks For Large-Scale Image Recognition Karen Simonyan, Andrew Zisserman : Apr 2015
Source
Implementation
Introduces the VGG network that won ImageNet in 2014. Deeper ConvNets. Takes input as (224 X 224) RGB and mean image subtracted as preprocessing. Two final FC hidden layers, followed by one FC layer with 1000 outputs.</description></item><item><title>Research Notes:: Deep Learning</title><link>https://nitishpuri.github.io/blog-hugo/research/machine-intelligence/research-ml/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nitishpuri.github.io/blog-hugo/research/machine-intelligence/research-ml/</guid><description>Very minimal notes on some papers or articles that I recently read.

Deep learning is setting new benchmarks everyday with the help of RNNs and CNNs. However, looking at problems that are not related to vision or sequential tasks, gradient boosting, random forests, or support vector machines are winning most of the competitions(Eg. Kaggle, HIGGS Challenge). With CNNs success, batch normalization and other stochastic regularization techniques has evolved into a standard.</description></item><item><title>Object Detection and Image Segmentation, Part 2</title><link>https://nitishpuri.github.io/blog-hugo/research/machine-intelligence/detect-segment-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nitishpuri.github.io/blog-hugo/research/machine-intelligence/detect-segment-2/</guid><description>Image Segmentation SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector Wei Liu, Dragomir Anguelov, Dumitru Erhan, Christian Szegedy, Scott Reed, Cheng-Yang Fu, Alexander C.

Code
Accurate approaches for image segmentation and object detection are available, like Faster R-CNN, but they are too slow for real time applications. Eliminates bounding box proposals and the subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage. Improvements include using a small convolutional filter to predict object categories and offsets in bounding box locations, using separate predictors (filters) for different aspect ratio detections, and applying these filters to multiple feature maps from the later stages of a network in order to perform detection at multiple scales.</description></item><item><title>Style Transfer, Part 1</title><link>https://nitishpuri.github.io/blog-hugo/research/machine-intelligence/style-transfer-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nitishpuri.github.io/blog-hugo/research/machine-intelligence/style-transfer-1/</guid><description>Style Transfer A Neural Style Algorithm of Artistic Style Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, Matthias Bethge : Sep 2015

In fine art, especially painting, humans have mastered the skill to create unique visual experiences through composing a complex interplay between the content and style of an image. Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities. Then we came across Deep Neural Networks.</description></item><item><title>Style Transfer, Part 2</title><link>https://nitishpuri.github.io/blog-hugo/research/machine-intelligence/style-transfer-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nitishpuri.github.io/blog-hugo/research/machine-intelligence/style-transfer-2/</guid><description>Style Transfer Artistic style transfer for videos Manuel Ruder, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Thomas Brox : Apr 2016
Source
The previously discussed techniques have been applied to videos on per frame basis. However, processing each frame of the video independently leads to flickering and false discontinuities, since the solution of the style transfer task is not stable. To regularize the transfer temporal constraints using optical flow are introduced. Notation $\mathbf p^{(i)}$ is the $i^{th}$ frame of the original video.</description></item></channel></rss>
